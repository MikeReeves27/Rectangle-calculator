# Rectangle calculator

A basic geometry calculator for a rectangle. This was my second personal Python project that I made for practise (after the circle calculator).

The program allows for a user to enter either a rectangle's **side lengths**, **perimeter**, or **area**, and the program will then automatically calculate the other fields based on their selection. It also lets them choose the decimal precision.

Another feature I added is scaling. No matter the value the user enters, the rectangle will never been less than 200 pixels or larger than 600 pixels on either side. This will stop the rectangle from spreading too far off-screen or becoming virtually invisible altogether. However, while the rectangle itself will still be visible on the canvas, the proportions of its lengths/area/etc will scale accordingly. (See screenshot for example)
